<a href="https://janware.nl/gitlab/upgrade.html">Upgrade Instructions for local installations</a>

<h2>Version 2.0.20</h2>
<p>The JanBan app can now be run from the internet instead of a local installation.</p>
<p>Your data will not be exposed, because the app still keeps everything within the context of Outlook.</p>
<p>This solves the issue for people who cannot - or do not want to - install software locally.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Changing to this new setup is just a matter of using another url as the home page of your Outlook Home Folder:</p>
<li>Right-click your Outlook Home Folder and then click Properties. Select the Home Page tab in the Properties dialog box.</li>
<li>In the Address box, type: <b>https://janware.nl/janban</b>. Click to select the Show home page by default for this folder check box and then click OK.</li>
<li>Or download and run the <a href="https://janware.nl/janban/install.cmd">install.cmd</a> batch file, which does this for you.</li>
<p></p>
<p>But of course you can stick to your local version. That's up to you.</p>

<h2>Version 2.0.18</h2>
<li>From now on previous versions will be kept at https://janware.nl/gitlab/. If you want to go back after an upgrade just download and install the version you want to have.</li>
<li>To better support users using the GTD planning method, a Someday/Maybe column has been added. It is hidden by default. Go to the Config screen to unhide it. The Someday column does not display due dates, and does not indicate if a task has high or low priority. It just lists the tasks.</li>
